# Disney_Movies_and_Box_Office_Success

Project Description:

Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, we will analyze data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release.
